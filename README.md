## Introduction

This is a simple react boilerplate code to be used to start your own react app.

The project here was started from scratch with information from the links below. It avoids complex and outdated alternatives like create-react-app .

To ease the development experience helpers like linters and code formatters are automatically executed for every git commit via git pre-commit hooks.
Code will be enhanced from time to time to support more features (e.g. testing, favicons, improving configs...)
